# Independent fx-991ES-style scientific calculator — LCD-only interaction

This is an independent educational web calculator based on the static CASIO emulator REA findings and user-provided visual reference. It does **not** import manufacturer's firmware, emulator libraries, artwork, or code from the existing GitHub implementation.

## Run it

Open `index.html` in a modern browser from this folder, or open the `fx991_fresh_standalone.html` file directly (all CSS/JS embedded). There are no runtime dependencies, no React and no Node.js.

## All operations take place inside the calculator

- Press **MODE** to open the LCD menu. Select a numbered item with **1–6**. Use **▶ / ◀** to move between menu pages. Press **AC** to exit.
- Press **SHIFT → MODE** to configure angle and output settings on the LCD.
- Each multi-field operation shows a **prompt on the LCD**. Enter a value using calculator keys, then press **=** to accept the value and advance. Press **▲** to go to the previous field; press **AC** to cancel.
- For an operation-selection field, **◀ / ▶** cycle between valid choices, then **=** confirms.
- Enter comma-separated rows or observations using **SHIFT + )** (comma). The hardware ALPHA keys enter X, Y, and memory variables. A physical keyboard can also type symbols and text directly into the active LCD prompt.
- Results appear on the LCD, with **▲ / ▼** for multiple result pages. **AC** returns to editing.
- **RCL** and **SHIFT + RCL** select memory registers with the LCD; **SHIFT + 9** opens CLR; **SHIFT + 7** opens constants.
- Optional diagnostic LCD magnification, screen capture, and KeyLog appear in inline panels below the calculator, not popup dialogs. They do not accept calculations.

The available advanced modes use educational workflows, not validated manufacturer firmware sequences. The independent 96 × 31 LCD raster, model behaviors, numerical precision and display glyphs have not been established as CASIO-hardware equivalent.

## Power lifecycle (REA-044)

- **Automatic power-off (APO):** after approximately **10 minutes (600,000 ms)** without a calculator-key operation, the display switches off. This applies to the supported fx-991ES, fx-991ES PLUS, and fx-991ES PLUS C model profiles, based on the corresponding CASIO manuals. Press **ON** to resume.
- **Stored state:** APO uses the same preservation policy as **SHIFT → AC (OFF)**: Ans, PreAns, A–F, X, Y, independent M memory, calculation mode, and SETUP remain stored in the current browser session. The volatile display and replay history clear. Refreshing the browser page still restarts this standalone simulator; it is not persistent storage.
- **Background tabs:** browsers may delay scheduled callbacks; the application compares the elapsed wall-clock time when a timer runs, on tab visibility changes, and before a calculator key executes.
- **Simulated battery:** actual battery capacity is **not measured**. For diagnostics, `FreshCalculator.setSimulatedBattery('low')` or `FreshCalculator.setSimulatedBattery('normal')` marks a simulation-only state visible through `FreshCalculator.getState().batterySimulation`. This does not change computational accuracy, emulate power drain, or claim a hardware battery reading.
- **Deterministic verification:** built-in self-checks validate the model policy, exact time-limit boundary, backwards-clock handling, and the simulation label using fixed input values; no test waits ten minutes. Runtime APO is handled by one cancellable inactivity timer. Device-equivalent power consumption and actual battery decline are out of scope.

## Files

- `index.html` — modular browser application.
- `styles.css` — calculator face and companion layout.
- `js/app.js` — LCD-only controller.
- `js/display.js` — independent LCD bitmap rasterizer.
- `js/math-engine.js` — independently authored arithmetic and numerical features.
- `js/keypad.js` — independent 50-key face.
- `fx991_fresh_standalone.html` — standalone HTML file with all CSS/JS embedded.
- `tests/all-modes-browser.py`, `tests/browser-flows.py` — optional development-only Playwright checks (Python); not needed to run the calculator.

## Verification

The built-in calculator checks pass **18/18**, and local Chromium browser tests successfully completed normal arithmetic, SETUP, MENU paging, TABLE, STAT, CMPLX, BASE-N, EQN, MATRIX, VECTOR, INEQ, VERIF, DIST, and numerical integration flows. Browser checks are source-behavior tests, not device-equivalence certification.
